I developed an app for blogging
First, there is the backend service, which manages users and posts, and stores the data in MongoDB.
In terms of posts, I developed a full crud.
When a user wants to connect, he sends a request to connect and then logs in. An userID can be used to delete, update, and find a user.

npm run start/nodemon :
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:5001 to view it in the browser.

npm run test/npm jest :
Runs the app unit test.
